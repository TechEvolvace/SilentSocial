# Lots of merge conflicts happen because of differences within the
# following files below that are meant to stay within your laptop's 
# environment and not shared with other developers or out in public in GitHub!

# This .gitignore file will help make it easier and automatic to ignore the 
# files that are not meant to be pushed to the GitHub repo SilentSocial!

# Therefore, any differences within the following files below won't be 
# pushed to the GitHub repo and won't cause any sudden merge conflicts 
# for any of us! Overall, this saves us from lots of frustration with merge 
# conflicts because of these files' differences in the future!

# Please DO NOT change or remove this .gitignore file, especially if you 
# have few or no ideas on what any of this does!
