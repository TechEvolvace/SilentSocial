# SilentSocial App
A social networking app focused on “non-verbal communication” where users can interact entirely through images, sketches, emojis, GIFs, or any other uncommon ways to communicate. Their mood-based gallery changes dynamically, encouraging expression through art and visuals over text and voice. By focusing on visuals, the app encourages emotional expression and a sense of comfort in online communities.
Many users find text- or voice-based communication stressful, limiting, or impersonal, especially when discussing emotions or personal experiences. Language barriers also create obstacles to meaningful interaction. Existing social apps heavily rely on written or spoken communication, leaving out users who prefer or require alternative ways to express themselves. SilentSocial addresses this gap by providing a safe, visual-first platform where users can engage authentically without being constrained by language or verbal expression.

## Deviations: 
* New Dashboard page with Gallery designed to improve user experience compared to original design submitted in the design phase
* New menu selection for users to be able to add image when creating new posts was a feature expansion not originally included in the design phase
* New Theme and Notifications page was a feature expansion from the original design submitted in the design phase
* Friend List & Search feature was delayed from Beta to Final to ensure robust implementation
* Mood Tracking was delayed from Beta to Final to better integrate with the post creation workflow
* Some Final release features (Prompts & Challenges, Push Notifications, Shareable Collections) were not implemented to focus resources on core functionality and user experience enhancements.

## Special Thanks:
* Phuc was the primary member that single-handedly reviewed and resolved all the merge conflicts that occurred throughout all 3 phases of the project (alpha, beta, and final). There were so many branches that new changes was pushed to that were way behind the main branch of this repo, and it took a lot of time, precision, and effort to keep those lagging branches with the new changes up to date and successfully merged in with other changes that other people made. From another perspective, he served the role of Quality Control really well since the merges always result in a functioning app with all new features from each of us added onto it, further enhancing the app overall closer to its completed state that we proposed.
